MintSupFlow.sh

Install some applications that I used some time ago into my workflow, the user can specify exactly what he wants to install using an whiptail interface.


NOTE: This script has been made a long time ago, issues can be reported for a fix, but I personally am not using it since I migrated to GNOME and arch based distro.


RHELSupFlow.sh

Install all the applications that I use in my workflow, also configure GNOME the way it fits me better.
